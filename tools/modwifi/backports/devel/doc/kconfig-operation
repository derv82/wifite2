 Theory of operation for Kconfig
=================================

This document explains briefly how how the Kconfig system works in the
backported code. It's obviously based on the original drivers' Kconfig
but is "hacked up" by the backporting process.


 Operation in the backport output tree
---------------------------------------

Let's start with the output, i.e. with the build-time Kconfig operation.
At build time, it is necessary to know what symbols are available in the
backported code, and in many cases also which are available in the kernel
it's being compiled against, e.g. to only allow selecting any PCI drivers
if PCI is enabled in the kernel.

As usual, the Kconfig tree starts with the file "Kconfig" at the root of
the output directory. This file ships in this repository in the backport
directory (but as all other Kconfig files will have been modified at the
backport output generation time.)

This "root" Kconfig file includes all the other Kconfig files that are
used to configure everything. This includes the compat/Kconfig file that
also ships in this repository and contains the backport symbols as well
as the generated ones -- Kconfig.kernel and Kconfig.versions.

These files (Kconfig.kernel and Kconfig.versions) are generated at build
time and depend on the kernel that they the backport is compiled against.
The former (Kconfig.kernel) is generated from the kernel's .config file
and contains all the Kconfig symbols (options) as hidden and unchangeable
options that the kernel has enabled. This addresses the dependency issue,
it will for example contain

config PCI
    bool
    default y

if the kernel has PCI enabled. For a modular option, here's an example:

config CORDIC
    tristate
    default m

(though if CORDIC was built into the kernel, it'd be "bool", but that's
immaterial for the usage here since it can't be changed anyway)

If the kernel doesn't have it then this will be missing, and any driver
that "depends on PCI" will not be selectable in the configuration.

The second file (Kconfig.versions) is generated from just the version of
the kernel and also contains invisible and unselectable boolean options
like

config KERNEL_X
    def_bool y

to indicate that APIs introduced in kernel version X (e.g. 3_3 for 3.3
or 2_6_24 for 2.6.24) must be backported. Essentially, the presence of
a symbol KERNEL_X indicates that the kernel that the code is
being compiled against is older than X.

All together, this allows the correct options to be selected by the user.

When using Linux backports as a packaged solution the the CONFIG_
environment variable is set to CPTCFG_ ("compat config", but also chosen
because it has the same length as CONFIG_). This shows up in the .config
file and other places, and in fact in all makefiles and in the code. The
reason for this is that it must be possible to distinguish between kernel
and backport options (even though we sort of port over kernel options).
This allows code to, for example, have "#ifdef CONFIG_PM" which can only
be set or cleared in the kernel, not in the backport configuration. Since
this is needed, a transformation step is done at backport creation time.

When using Linux backports to integrate into an existing Linux tree
the CONFIG_BACKPORT_ prefix is used, this allows a CONFIG_BACKPORT_
symbol to depend on the non-backported respective symbol to be selected
allowing these to be mutually exclusive.

 Backport creation for Kconfig
-------------------------------

In order to achieve correct operation with all the above, multiple steps
are necessary during the backport creation process.

These are the problems and their solutions:
 1) As just mentioned, all symbols are now named CPTCFG_* instead of the
    original CONFIG_*. This requires that all code files (and makefiles)
    are updated to use CPTCFG_* and CPTCFG_*_MODULE instead of the CONFIG_
    versions of the same. However, not *all* CONFIG_* usage may be changed
    since some options must come from the kernel still. More importantly,
    kernel options "leak" into the backport build and the rename avoids
    using them. For example, if MAC80211_DEBUGFS is enabled in the kernel
    that the backports are compiled against, but disabled in the backport
    configuration, the rewrite ensures that it really is disabled and the
    CONFIG_MAC80211_DEBUGFS symbol that "leaked" from the kernel has no
    effect on the backport compilation.
    To achieve this, all Kconfig files are walked during the backporting
    process, starting at the root "Kconfig", and any symbols defined in
    them collected. Later then, only those options are renamed. They are
    also recorded for the build process in the output file .local-symbols.

 2) Kconfig files may reference files that don't exist when they're copied
    but not all the drivers, e.g. drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig is copied
    but only a single driver, e.g. iwlwifi, so references to other drivers
    will not exist.
    To address this, the backport process records which files it can find
    while walking the Kconfig tree. Later, any reference to files that
    don't exist in the backport output is commented out. Note that in this
    process, the files 'Kconfig.kernel' and 'Kconfig.versions' need to be
    ignored since they will be generated at build time.

 3) Kconfig files may include configuration options that cannot be built,
    for example when the drivers/net/wireless/Makefile is copied it will
    have options for old drivers like AIRO etc. which aren't copied into
    the output.
    To address this, the generation process also walks the Makefile tree
    (see also the 'makefile-operation' file) and collects all options
    referencing files or directories that don't exist. These options are
    then modified in the Kconfig file to "depend on n", making them not
    selectable (I considered removing them entirely but that seemed too
    brittle.)

 4) Some code simply cannot be built on very old kernels, e.g. Bluetooth
    requires at least 2.6.29 due to the shash crypto code. This cannot be
    determined easily automatically, so the 'dependencies' file is read
    and options that are listed there are rewritten to include
        depends on !KERNEL_X_Y
    (where X_Y is the listed kernel version), which makes them available
    only on kernels >= X.Y.

 5) It's impossible to select options to be built-in, so all tristate
    config options are changed to "depends on m" to force them modular.
