 Theory of operation for output Makefiles
==========================================

This document explains briefly how how the Makefile system works in the
backported code. It's obviously based on the kernel's Makefile system
but must be modified by the backporting process to work.


 Operation in the backport output tree
---------------------------------------

Again, let's start with how it works in the result and not with how the
modifications are made. There are a few different Makefiles that are used
to achieve this result -- you can look into the details there.

At build time, the very first thing the make system has to do is ensure
the Kconfig.kernel and Kconfig.versions files exist and are up-to-date,
this is done by reading the kernel's .config file and storing its md5sum
to make sure it can react to changes.

Once these are in place, the configuration process can start with any of
the tools -- menuconfig, defconfig-*, ...

When the configuration is complete and exists in .config, the autoconf
header (backport-include/backport/autoconf.h) must be generated. This step is
also done in the make system (by a small embedded shell script) and needs
the .local-symbols so it only includes the symbols from the backport.

After this exists, all that's left to do is source the .config file and
export everything in there into the environment for calling the kernel's
build system.


 Backport creation for Makefiles
---------------------------------

Similar to Kconfig (see the "kconfig-operation" file) there are issues
with just taking the kernel's makefiles and attempting to use them out
of tree. The "wrapper" make system is described above, but some other
transformations are needed.

First though, one "root" Makefile is shipped with the backport tree, the
file Makefile.kernel. This is the file that the kernel sees and it has
references to all the makefiles that the backport is supposed to include.
Some of these may also be invalid/stale, like in any Makefile copied from
the kernel.

The main thing here is that some symbols may refer to another directory
or C file that doesn't exist. For example, this:

obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo/

If the foo/ directory wasn't copied into the backport, then the symbol
FOO will be disabled in the Kconfig, and not treated as a local one.
Therefore, if CONFIG_FOO is set in the base kernel, the make system may
attempt to recurse into the foo/ directory and fail the build. Thus, any
such references that cannot be satisfied due to missing code are changed
to
obj-$(IMPOSSIBLE_FOO) += foo/

This preserves the original intent and makefile syntax while disabling
the recursion that would fail.

NOTE: The makefile parser in the generation script is very very basic and
      really only works for this particular syntax that the kernel uses.

      Right now, the parser doesn't even understand line continuations,
      though this would be fairly to fix.

      Also, the parser doesn't understand temporary variables and then
      sometimes disables things it shouldn't, this is the reason for the
      brcm80211 patches (at the time of writing -- those patches might be
      acceptable upstream.)

      Finally, the parser thinks that .o files can only be built from .c
      files, so any other files won't be handled correctly.
