Linux 3.5 will have get_ts_info to support the Precision Time Protocol.

We cannot backport this support given that this introduces
a data structure change on the ethtool_ops.

    ethtool: Introduce a method for getting time stamping capabilities.
    
    This commit adds a new ethtool ioctl that exposes the SO_TIMESTAMPING
    capabilities of a network interface. In addition, user space programs
    can use this ioctl to discover the PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) device
    associated with the interface.
    
    Since software receive time stamps are handled by the stack, the generic
    ethtool code can answer the query correctly in case the MAC or PHY
    drivers lack special time stamping features.
