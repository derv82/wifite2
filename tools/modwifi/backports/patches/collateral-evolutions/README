============================================

You must have a really good reason to be adding files
in this directory. Your reasoning should either match the
explanation already present on the top of each patch file
or you should add your own.

We try to avoid having patch files because:

  * Its a pain in the ass to maintain them.

  * Most backport changes can be pulled off through
    some macro magic or new files which implement
    the new functionality on the old kernels.
